Changelog (MATLAB and Python)
=============================

Version 2.0
-----------

What is new in ver 2.0:

* From version 2.0, in addition to MATLAB and GNU Octave, OCEANLYZ is available for Python language through OCEANLYZ package
* From version 2.0, OCEANLYZ is a class (instead of function). It allows OCEANLYZ to be called inside user code.
* Bug fix (MATLAB): remove 'obj' as an input arguments from oceanlyzmodule() and oceanlyzecalcwave() methods (2021-07-08)
* Bug fix: removed '/(Rho*1000)' from mean water depth calculation in oceanlyzecalcwave() method (2021-08-03)
* Bug fix (Python): removed -1 from index of if autofmaxpcorr=='on': in PcorFFTFun function (2021-08-07)
* Bug fix : Add 'if tailcorrection=='jonswap' or tailcorrection=='tma':' in WaveSpectraFun and SeaSwellFun functions (2021-10-26)
* Release date: 2020-10-27

Version 1.5
-----------

What is new in ver 1.5:

* Now, a wave spectrum in PcorFFTFun function is obtained from pwelch function instead of fft function

* Parameter 'duration' changed to 'burst_duration'
* Release date: 2020-8-5
