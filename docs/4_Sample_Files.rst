Sample Files
============

With this package, two sample files are provided. The first file is named “input.mat”, and contains one burst of data recorded by a pressure sensor. It can be used as an input for any of function. The second file is named “waterdepthsample.mat”, and contains five bursts of data recorded by a pressure sensor. It can be used as an input file while using “RunOceanlyz.m” file.
